## Assignment || DevOps Engineer

As per my assignment I have created 3 services in AWS namely API Gateway, Lambda Function and DynamoDB Table

- API Gateway — This service is responsible for deploying and serving HTTP RESTful endpoints. Thus you can trigger actions, when HTTP calls arrives to the generated endpoints.
- Lambda — This let you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
- DynamoDB — The NoSQL amazon database, where you can insert the information of your application on tables (Collections).

I have written code in Python language
